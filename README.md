# Password_Generator
Python password generator with 3 different levels of strength:
  1. Weak passwords - generates a password from 1 to 3 words, separated by '_'; can make 532525393036 different combinations with the code as is.
  2. Medium strength passwords - generates a password from 4 to 7 pieces, with each piece being either a character or a word, separated by either nothing, "_", or "-"; can make 1904417366083219609146 different combinations with the code as is.
  3. Strong passwords - generates a password just from individual characters, with the length of 30 or more; unlimited combinations?

Apart from being a password generator, the weak password option also makes some funny, nickname-worthy sequences :)
